# ZeroFox Patch Development Guide

## Workflow

1. Run `../scripts/fetch-esr.sh` to get the Firefox source.
2. Make changes in the source tree under `../src/firefox-<version>/`.
3. Generate a patch:
   ```
   cd ../src/firefox-<version>
   hg diff > ../../patches/00N-my-change.patch
   # OR if using plain git/diff:
   diff -Naur original_file modified_file > ../../patches/00N-my-change.patch
   ```
4. Test applying cleanly: `patch -p1 --dry-run < ../../patches/00N-my-change.patch`
5. Patches are applied in lexicographic order by `apply-patches.sh`.

## Patch naming

`NNN-short-description.patch` — three-digit prefix for ordering.

## Stub patches

Patches with `# STUB` as the first line are skipped by `apply-patches.sh`. Remove
that line once the patch contains real diff content.
