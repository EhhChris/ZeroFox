# ZeroFox

A set of patches for building a branded version of Firefox ESR browser that attempts to restrict users from removing data from the browser or otherwise persisting it locally. ZeroFox is **not** a complete solution, and really only makes sense when the deployment and operating environment is largely controlled and the user has no elevated privileges. The intended purpose is to provide a moderate approach to data loss prevention strategies with less intense external infrastructure requirements and less user impact on performance for use in **controlled** environments.

**Currently only built and tested against FireFox ESR 140.9.1**

As this project progresses tags will be cut and attempt to follow the latest ESR releases.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3, Rust, Node.js (required by Firefox build system — see [Firefox build docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/))
- ~20 GB free disk space for the source + build artifacts

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Bootstrap the Firefox build system (first time only)
./scripts/fetch-esr.sh            # downloads & verifies Firefox ESR source
cd src/firefox-$(cat src/.esr_version)
./mach bootstrap                  # installs Rust, cbindgen, etc.
cd ../..

# 2. Build
./build.sh # Attempts the full build process on the last esr version pulled by fetch-esr.sh
```

## Patch status

**TODO:** create new table for this once closer to reality and more human review is done.
